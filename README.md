# VicHop
A macro made by ninju and ayaanaaa

## Our mission
the goal of the VicHop macro was to communicate with multiple alts about the day/night cycle and have main accounts join the alts once vicious is found in their server.
We use the Socket.ahk library to create a connection between the alt accounts.

## How it should look:
lets define some names:
```diff
-Server:
a private server (n is the amount of servers you have.
The more servers the more stingers you'll get)
-Call:
A call happens when one account tells another account
to join their server
-Passive Alts:
for every server except main, you need 1 passive alt.
these passive alts will sit in the server with an unclaimed hive
and constantly check the day cycle
-Searcher:
once a passive alt detects night time in his server,
he calls a searcher to check if there is a vicious bee
in the passive alts server.
These searchers need at least 35 bees and access
to the red cannon and need the mountain top parachute.
Its recommended to have 2 searchers
-Main:
this is the account you will get the stingers.
once a searcher confirms a vicious bee,
it calls the main account which goes to the field and kills it.
In the searchers call, he also includes the location
of the vicious bee to have the fastest rotation possible
```
